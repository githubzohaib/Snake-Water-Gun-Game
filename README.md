# 🎮 Snake Water Gun Game - Day 56 of TheUltimatePythonCourse:

I had the opportunity to develop a Snake Water Gun game as part of my Python learning journey on the 56th day of the course. Here's a brief breakdown of the rules I followed:

1. **Snake vs. Water:** 🐍 Snake drinks water and wins.


2. **Water vs. Gun:** 💧 Water drowns the gun and wins.


3. **Gun vs. Snake:** 🔫 Gun kills the snake and wins.



# My Approach:

I used the if-elif conditions to handle the game logic. First, I assigned numbers:

**1 for Snake**

**2 for Water**

**3 for Gun**


To make it more exciting, I integrated the random module, allowing the computer to randomly choose between Snake, Water, or Gun. Players got 10 chances to compete. Each time, the user inputs their choice, and the computer selects randomly.

To keep track, I created separate variables for:

**Total draws**

**My wins**

**Computer wins**

I added color patterns (blue and red) to make the game more visually appealing and easily differentiable.

# Key Takeaway:

It was a small yet highly valuable project that gave me great insights into game development logic and Python fundamentals. Looking forward to more projects like this as I continue to progress. 🚀
